ChordsML
========

A simple XML for chord notation and accompanying XSLT and CSS for rendering it in HTML.

This is a work in progress. It is currently functional, albeit a little utilitarian. Please feel free to contribute.

Format

<c r="A" q="m" n="7" b="D" />

c = chord

r = root

q = quality (minor, for major, leave blank)

n = number

b = bass note

<c r="A" q="m" n="7" b="D" /> = Am7/D
